<p>The goal of this tutorial is twofold. First, the tutorial enables the developers to explore the main functional components of ChainTracker, including the transformation visualizations and their semantics, the code projections, and the contextual information tables. Second, the tutorial guides developers through a simple pedagogical case study where they will be able to use the “filtering by element” and “filtering by binding” features in order to answer questions regarding the dependencies between the generation artefacts in a model-based code generator. </p>

<p> Model transformations can be used to tackle a wide rage of software engineering tasks. However, over the last 10 years model-based code generation has been the flagship software engineering paradigm backing the adoption of transformation technologies. This tutorial uses a simple model-based code generator to illustrate ChainTracker's features. It consists of one model-to-model and one model-to-text transformation that collaborate in order to transform the contents of a bookstore database into an anonymus publucation index. In turn the index is printed in an HTLM form. </p>

<p>1. In order to load a single transformation or a composition of transformations click on > Chain Configuration > Load Transformation Chain (Fig. 0). You will see the transformation loader window as presented below (Fig. 1). You can add as many transformations as you want, both model-to-model (M2M) and model-to-text (M2T) written in ATL and Acceleo are accepted by the tool. ChainTracker will automatically statically and dynamically analyze their dependencies. </p>

<p>2. To load the Book2Publication (M2M) and Publication2HTML (M2T) composition, click > Open, and locate each one of them in the folder > examples/m2m and examples/m2t respectively. You will also have to indicate the path of the source and target metamodels for all M2M transformations, and the source metamodel, and model instance for every M2T transformation.</p>
